## Description

Help Bartholomew construct his dream golf course.

Created for GMTK Game Jam 2023. Placed #114 out of 6769 entries.

Place bumpers, buttons, and boosters so Bartholomew's customers get a hole in one. However, every item you place counts as a stroke for you! So aim to stay under par and solve fun and engaging puzzles.
