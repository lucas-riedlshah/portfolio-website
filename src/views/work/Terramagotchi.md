## What is Terramagotchi?

Terramagotchi is a nearist neighbour pixel simulation inspired by the classic [Falling-sand game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-sand_game). It simulates a simplified version of the water and nutrient cycles found in nature. It was created to be displayed on a portrait monitor, hence the portrait aspect ratio.

There is a QR code displayed in the bottom left, which when scanned will lead you to a "remote" website (powered by Firebase) via which you can add various particle types into the environment. The concept for this remote was that, when the main piece is displayed to an audience, they may all interact with it at once.

## Why is Terramagotchi?

Terramagotchi was created as my capstone project, alongside my team, to close out my Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science. The purpose of the capstone project is to work in a small team and demonstrate the knowledge we have learnt over the course of our degree, and to further develop our technical and communication skills.

_Created by Lucas RiedlShah, Dominik Lange, Giovanni Glendining, Dion Wharerau and Blake Louis for Simon Ingram and Terrestrial Assemblages._
